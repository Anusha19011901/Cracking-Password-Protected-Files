Our goal is to create Advanced Password Cracking Tool with support for Bruteforce Attacks,
Dictionary Attacks, Random Attacks. This tool is capable of cracking files and hashes like
PDF, Zip, MS Excel, MS World, MS Power Point, MD5, Sha1, Sha224, Sha256, Sha384,
Sha512, Blake2B, Blake2S.
● Brute Force Attacks
A brute force attack uses trial-and-error to guess login info, encryption keys, or find a
hidden web page. Hackers work through all possible combinations hoping to guess
correctly.
These attacks are done by ‘brute force’ meaning they use excessive forceful attempts
to try and ‘force’ their way into your private account(s).
● Dictionary Attacks
In a dictionary attack, an attacker can theoretically use every word in a dictionary as a
password for a password-protected system in order to get access to it.
The dictionary may include terms from an English dictionary as well as a leaked list of
frequently used passwords. When paired with substituting common characters with
digits, the dictionary may occasionally be highly efficient and quick.
● Random Attacks
This will use any random attacks to crack the password protected file or to crack a hash.
